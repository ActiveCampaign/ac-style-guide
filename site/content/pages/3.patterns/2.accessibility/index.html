checklist_description: 'Those with color blindness require a unique set of distinguishable <a href="/brand/colors">colors</a>, while those with low sight require easily identifying colors for actionable elements. For those with little to no sight abilities there needs to be a specific set of standards in place so that they can still use our products. Below, we go through the various ways in which we combat impairments throughout our products here at ActiveCampaign with a easy to reference checklist.'

  <p class="fs-4 lh-4">Throughout our products our primary focus is adhering to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">WCAG AA</a> (4.5:1) with some exceptions.

  <p class="fs-4 lh-4 pb-8"><sup>1</sup> About 8% of all men are suffering from color blindness while another 1 in 200 women suffering from it as well. This requires a unique set of colors throughout our palette to insure each are easily distinguishable from one another. There are three main types of color vision deficiency: protan, deutan, and tritan defects. These three types are shown below using our <a href="/brand/colors/">primary color palette</a>.

  <p class="fs-4 lh-4">Ensuring those with more severe visual impairments have complete control and access to our products, the following should be considered in any case:
  </p>
  <ul class="fs-4 lh-4 pl-5">
  	<li class="pb-2">If using an image, provide an adequate <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_alt.asp" target="_blank" title="ALT attribute">ALT attribute</a> for description and include an <a href="http://w3c.github.io/html-reference/aria/aria.html" target="_blank">ARIA attribute</a> for screen readers when necessary. </li>
  	<li class="pb-2">Controls should be clearly identifiable via all their states and accessible for screen readers. They should be easy to navigate using <a href="https://ac-styleguide.herokuapp.com/patterns/accessibility#keyboard-control">keyboard controls</a> and <a href="https://ac-styleguide.herokuapp.com/brand/colors">colors</a> should adhere to our <a href="https://ac-styleguide.herokuapp.com/brand/colors#usage">color usage guide</a>.</li>
  	<li class="pb-2">Controls should always be consistent and predictable.</li>
  	<li class="pb-2">Text sizes and line heights should be sized appropriately and have the ability to be adjusted if needed by the user.</li>
  	<li class="pb-2">Text colors should be chosen carefully. Rever to our typography color guide for more information.</li>
  	<li class="pb-2">Navigational elements should be clearly identifiable and understandable by a screen reader. They should also be easy to use via <a href="https://ac-styleguide.herokuapp.com/patterns/accessibility#keyboard-control">keyboard controls</a>.</li>
  	<li class="pb-2">Form elements and user input controls should be easily identifiable by a screen reader and easy to navigate using <a href="https://ac-styleguide.herokuapp.com/patterns/accessibility#keyboard-control">keyboard controls</a>.</li>
  	<li class="pb-2">Visual feedback should be described and accessible by a screen reader. Examples include loading states, notifications and status updates, animations and control state changes such as focus/active or hover.</li>

  <p class="fs-6 fw-600"> Motor, Neurological or Cognitive
  </p>
  <p class="fs-4 lh-4">As with severe visual impairments, motor, neurological and cognitive impairments can have many challenges for accessibility. Below the following should be considered in any case:
  </p>
  <ul class="pl-5 fs-4 lh-4">
  	<li class="pb-2">Navigation should be consistent with other instances and easy to understand.</li>
  	<li class="pb-2">Controls and inputs should not require precision to activate/focus or require a mouse exclusively. Each control should be keyboard accessible. Refer to the section below <a href="https://ac-styleguide.herokuapp.com/patterns/accessibility#keyboard-control">Keyboard Control</a> for more information.</li>
